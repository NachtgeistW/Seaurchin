# Seaurchin
某スライドして手を跳ね上げる音ゲーシミュレーター

このプロジェクトは [kb10uy](https://github.com/kb10uy)氏が開発されていた音ゲーシミュレーター「Seaurchin」に
[Amenoshita-429](https://github.com/Amenoshita-429)が独自に改良、修正、拡張を加えたものになります。
現段階ではこのプロジェクトにおける開発は**Seaurchinの正式な後継バージョンの開発ではありません**のでご注意ください。

このAmenoshita-429版Seaurchinはkb10uy版Seaurchinとは一部仕様が異なる可能性があります。
また、予告なく仕様、挙動が変更される可能性が大いにあります。予めご了承ください。

Amenoshita-429版Seaurchinはkb10uy版Seaurchinに対し若干の軽量化と動作の安定を図るために比較的大規模な変更を行っています。
そのためkb10uy版で正常に動作していた機能がAmenoshita-429版ではむしろ正常に機能しない可能性があります。

## ダウンロード
当面の間は[こちら](https://github.com/kb10uy/Seaurchin/releases)からkb10uy版Seaurchinがダウンロードが可能だと思われます。

Amenoshita-429版Seaurchinは将来的に[こちら](https://github.com/Amenoshita-429/Seaurchin/releases)からダウンロードが可能になる可能性があります。
